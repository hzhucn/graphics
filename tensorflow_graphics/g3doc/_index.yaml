      description: >
        The last few years have seen a rise in novel differentiable graphics layers
        which can be inserted in neural network architectures. From spatial transformers
        to differentiable graphics renderers, these new layers leverage the knowledge
        acquired over years of computer vision and graphics research to build new and
        more efficient network architectures. Explicitly modeling geometric priors and
        constraints into neural networks opens up the door to architectures that can be
        trained robustly, efficiently, and more importantly, in a self-supervised
        fashion.
        We aim at bringing some of these functionalities into TensorFlow, in order to stimulate
        research and developmen in this field by making useful graphics functions widely accessible
        to the community. TensorFlow Graphics provides a set of differentiable graphics layers
        (e.g. cameras and reflectance models) and 3D functionalities
        (e.g. mesh convolution, 3D tensorboard) that can be used in your machine learning
        models of choice.
